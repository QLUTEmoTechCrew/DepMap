# DepMap
We propose Dep-MAP, a video-based depression assessment model for complex facial behaviors. A dual-branch design extracts facial features and emotional semantics, learning severity-specific prototypes. Prototype-supervised contrastive learning aligns visual cues, reducing semantic confusion and achieving state-of-the-art results on AVEC2013/2014.
